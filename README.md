## End notes
I am aware that the tests were very simple, sadly for the time being I don't know how to write other. I should be able to learn writing more complex ones in about a month time.
I wasn't sure what properties there should be for /movies and hope that my choice is acceptable.
I sincerly hope you will find this simple API passable.
Thank you for your interest.
